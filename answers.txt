1. Purpose of .git directory:
   The .git directory is the core of a Git repository. It stores all the metadata and object database of your project, including commits, branches, and tags. It contains the complete history and version control information.

2. Difference between git pull and git fetch:
   - git fetch only downloads new data from the remote repository but doesn't integrate it into your working files
   - git pull downloads new data AND automatically merges it into your current working branch

3. Purpose of the staging area:
   The staging area (or index) is a intermediate area where changes are prepared before committing. It allows you to selectively choose which changes to include in your next commit.

4. Command to unstage a file:
   git restore --staged <file>
   or
   git reset HEAD <file>

5. Difference between git revert and git reset:
   - git revert creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit
   - git reset actually moves the branch pointer backwards, effectively removing commits

7. Command to list all branches:

   - Facilitates project maintenance and collaboration

10. What happens if you use git push without committing:
    Nothing will be pushed to the remote repository because git push only pushes committed changes. Uncommitted changes remain in your working directory.
